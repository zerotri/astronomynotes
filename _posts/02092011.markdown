### Objectives:
1.	List the 7 members of the EM spectrum in order of
	increasing energy (cont.)
1.	Define a "wave", "wavelength" & "frequency"
1.	Define a "photon"
1.	Discuss 3 properties of EMR, or waves (reflection,
	refraction, diffraction) and cite an example of each.

### Properties of EMR
*	Refraction

*	Reflection  
	![Reflection & Diffraction](content/reflection-diffraction.png)
*	Diffraction  
	EMR bending around corners or edges.

#### Light
White Light - Light containing all of visible colors  
Spectrum - a dispersed ray of EMR

##### 3 types of spectra
1.	Continuous Spectrum (white light)  
	All visible colors - no breaks; obtained from white light. White light is emitted from a _dense_ solid, liquid or gas.
1.	Bright Line (Emission) Spectrum  
	Obtained when you disperse the light from a hot, thin gas.
1.	Dark Line (Absorbtion) Spectrum

##### How does a rainbow work?
1.	Water refracts in a water drop and disperses, then reflects back to us, creating a visible spectrum.
